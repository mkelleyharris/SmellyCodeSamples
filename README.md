SmellyCodeSamples
=================

Welcome to my Smelly Code Sample repository. Since this all opensource which was in many cases already on GitHub,
I should fork. However I tried that several times in a row and I never could get Eclipse to recognize it was legitmate
Java code. In the end I gave up and just copied the code wholesale.

This code is from
@Jbrains: https://github.com/jbrains/trivia
@amckinnell: https://github.com/amckinnell/Data-Warehouse-Value-Cleaner.git
The Domination/Risk Game on sourceforge
@pranavnabar: https://github.com/pranavnabar/code_smells.git
